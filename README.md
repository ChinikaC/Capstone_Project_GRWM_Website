## 1. Project Description

As part of our capstone project, we had to create an API and the client-side for the API in less than two weeks. Our group decided to base our project on personalised outfit inspirations whilst also promoting body positivity, as this was something we had not seen before and we wanted to set ourselves a challenge. This ‘Get Ready with Me’ website is a styling platform, designed with the user in mind allowing women to embrace their individual sense of style by making chosing an outfit easy. There is a short quiz for the user to fill out and once they have done this outfit collages will be generated, using an algorithm, based on the user's answers.

### UML

Our UML includes our models, enum and service layer. All of our methods are displayed here.

### ERD

Our ERD displays the many-to-many relationship that we had between the collage and user - each user could end up with many collages and each collage can be assigned to many users. As a result, we only needed one join table, the 'collageList'.

### Wireframe

Our wireframe shows what our MVP was, and a rough idea of how we intended our website to look like. We seperated the sections by MVP and extension so we could organise our time better.

### Components Diagram

Our components diagram showcases the different sections that we had in our JavaScript file. We have our main GRWMContainer, pages and components and how they link to one another.
